# Final-Year-Project :- RFID Tag Cloner
This repository contains all code created for my final year project. This is an Arduino-based project.

## Development
  **This project is continuing to be developed.**
  
  This project is currently unfinished and the complete functionality of the project hasn't been achieved yet. This project should be complete by March 24th.

## Compatibility
This project was created using ``Arduino IDE version 1.8.19`` and cannot be guaranteed to be supported on any older versions.

## Components
  - 1 x Arduino UNO (or maybe ESP8266)
  - 1 x LCD1602 Module (with pin header)
  - 1 x Potentiometer 10k
  - 1 x RC522 RFID Module
  - 4 x Button
  - 1 x 830 Tie-Points Breadboard
  - 7 x Female-to-Male Dupont Wire
  - 25 x Breadboard Jumper Wire

## Hardware Setup
### Pin Layout

### Technical Issues
  Test files have been created for each component used in the project to test its functionality and any potential faults with the hardware.
  
  When using a test file, follow the Hardware setup given in the comments at the top of the file. The project should work if the setup has been followed correctly. If not, it is likely the hardware you are trying to us is broken and faulty, **and must be replaced.**
